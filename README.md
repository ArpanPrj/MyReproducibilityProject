# RNA-Seq Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a complete and reproducible pipeline for RNA-seq analysis aimed at understanding transcriptional responses in *Fusarium* species when treated with host-derived biological extracts. Specifically, this study investigates two fungal pathogens:

- *Fusarium cucurbiticola* exposed to zucchini extract
- *Fusarium bataticola* exposed to sweet potato extract

All scripts and output files are organized into separate folders: `Fusarium_cucurbiticola/` and `Fusarium_bataticola/`, ensuring clear separation of analyses for the two species.

## Overview of the RNA-Seq Pipeline

Each species-specific workflow follows these key steps:

### 1. Data Retrieval and Initial Quality Assessment

**Goal:** Obtain RNA-seq data and evaluate raw read quality.

- RNA-seq datasets are downloaded directly from the NCBI SRA using the **SRA Toolkit**.
- Each sample is retrieved in paired-end format and automatically split into forward and reverse reads.
- **FastQC** is then used to assess the quality of the raw reads, checking metrics such as:
  - Per-base sequence quality
  - Adapter content
  - Sequence duplication levels
  - GC content
- Quality reports are archived for easy visualization and transfer.

- [`Fusarium_cucurbiticola/0_1_download_QualityCheck.sh`](./Fusarium_cucurbiticola/0_1_download_QualityCheck.sh)  
- [`Fusarium_bataticola/0_1_download_QualityCheck.sh`](./Fusarium_bataticola/0_1_download_QualityCheck.sh)

### 2. Adapter Trimming and Post-Trim Quality Control

**Goal:** Remove low-quality regions and sequencing adapters.

- **Trimmomatic** is used to:
  - Remove Illumina adapters
  - Trim low-quality bases from ends
  - Discard reads below a minimum length threshold
- Cleaned paired and unpaired reads are generated.
- Post-trim **FastQC** reports are produced to confirm read quality improvement.

ðŸ“„ Scripts:
- [`Fusarium_cucurbiticola/2_cleanTrimmomatic_QualityFastQC.sh`](./Fusarium_cucurbiticola/2_cleanTrimmomatic_QualityFastQC.sh)  
- [`Fusarium_bataticola/2_cleanTrimmomatic_QualityFastQC.sh`](./Fusarium_bataticola/2_cleanTrimmomatic_QualityFastQC.sh)

### 3. Read Alignment and Transcript Quantification

**Goal:** Map RNA-seq reads to the genome and quantify expression.

- The reference genome is preprocessed using **gffread** to format GTF annotations.
- The genome is indexed using **HISAT2**, which supports spliced alignment across exon-exon junctions.
- Cleaned reads are aligned to the reference genome using HISAT2.
- The resulting SAM files are:
  - Converted to BAM
  - Sorted and indexed using **SAMtools**
- **StringTie** assembles transcripts and quantifies expression levels in a reference-guided manner.
- The **prepDE.py** utility is used to compile gene- and transcript-level count matrices for DE analysis.

ðŸ“„ Scripts:
- [`Fusarium_cucurbiticola/3_mapper_hisat2.sh`](./Fusarium_cucurbiticola/3_mapper_hisat2.sh)  
- [`Fusarium_bataticola/3_mapper_hisat2.sh`](./Fusarium_bataticola/3_mapper_hisat2.sh)

### 4. Differential Expression Analysis

**Goal:** Identify genes with significant expression changes in response to treatment.

- Gene-level count matrices generated by StringTie are processed using **DESeq2** in R.
- The analysis includes:
  - Normalization of raw counts
  - Statistical testing to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
  - Visualization via MA plots and volcano plots
- DEGs are filtered based on log2 fold-change and adjusted p-value cutoffs.

### 5. Functional Enrichment and Visualization

**Goal:** Understand biological significance of differentially expressed genes.

- Functional enrichment analysis (e.g., GO, KEGG) is conducted using R packages such as `clusterProfiler`.
- Enriched terms are visualized using dot plots, barplots, and pathway diagrams.
- Outputs help interpret fungal response to host extracts at the systems level.
