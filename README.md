# RNA-Seq Data Analysis Project
This repository contains the complete pipeline and associated scripts for RNA-seq data analysis performed as part of a research project investigating transcriptional changes in *Fusarium* species response to specific biological conditions. The workflow spans from raw sequencing data preprocessing to differential gene expression analysis and downstream functional annotation.

**Key steps in this project include**

- Quality control and trimming of raw reads

- Alignment to reference genome

- Transcript quantification

- Differential expression analysis

- Functional enrichment and visualization

The repository aims to ensure reproducibility and transparency in analysis. All code is version-controlled, documented, and organized to allow others to replicate or adapt the workflow for their own studies.
